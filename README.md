Ark CMS

I wanted a better CMS. so I am making one.

Feel free to join the ride. but it is paved with anger and fear at the moment as this is nowhere near complete. but hey it has got me programming again.

Code is not amazing. I am a basic developer. me no use fancy stuff. Feel free to crituqe me in every aspect on the issues page.

Ark is built using NodeJS, Express, Nunjucks and MongoDB. I hope to implement some cool stuff like auto file minification and a static page cache to improve site speed.

This CMS takes a lot of design aspects from my favorite CMS ProcessWire. but I feel like I could make improvements to that CMS by ditching PHP and making use of Nunjucks as a template engine and if needed custom middleware so developers can code a page with whatever their heart desires. 

for example I have used ProcessWire on websites like [arkena.cf](https://arkena.cf) to add custom stats lookup pages and server statuses. but ProcessWire makes that easy but also a bit too messy for my liking as its literal PHP files all crammed together instead of a nice dependency system like NPM which in the long run would make things simpler than random PHP libaries all stored in a template folder.

The purpose is to make a CMS that makes it easy to maintain. not a total pain.
